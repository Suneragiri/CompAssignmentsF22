# Introduction to Github

We are so excited to start our Fall '22 Comp for Crimson Tech!

## A. GitHub account

We will be communicating through GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub account, please sign up at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

#### Only for Window Users: Get WSL!

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and get Ubuntu. Then, follow Richard's email to learn about how to setup a Windows-accessible folder in WSL. From here, use WSL instead of the command line!

## B. Adding an SSH key.

If you don’t know what an ssh key is, follow these instructions. This step is tricky! **Feel free to call NK/KL over.**

We need to link the account you just made to your local machine. The ssh key is like the identity of a computer, and is how GitHub knows to trust your machine.

Run the command `ssh-keygen` and hit Enter a few times, leaving the files blank. Then, run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` . You should get a string that goes `ssh-rsa [a bunch of characters]`. Copy it.

Go to github, click on your user and go to Settings. Click on `SSH and GPG keys` and click on `New SSH key` and paste the key you got into there.

## C. Fork this repository.

Come back to [https://github.com/kevinzluo/CompAssignmentsF22](https://github.com/kevinzluo/CompAssignmentsF22
). You should see a button on the upper right called **Fork**. Click it! Now, you should have your personal copy of this repository.

Next, you need to **clone** this repository onto your machine. Click on the green `code` option and copy the string you have there. Then, in your terminal, type in `git clone [the string you just received]`.

If you get an error, chances are the SSH key step did not work. **Call us over.**

**DO NOT CONTINUE UNTIL YOU HAVE DONE STEPS A-C**

We will now install 3 tools: Git, Python and pip.

1.  Git, with GitHub, is how you will be submitting your assignments.
2.  Python is a programming language.
3.  Pip is the python package manager. You can greatly extend the power of Python with it.

## D. Install Git

Open up your terminal and type in `git --version`. If you get an error, you need to install Git. Follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install it.

Once you are done, put your git version into `lab0-responses.txt`.

## E. Install Python

Type in `python --version`. If you get an error, you need to install Python: follow the instructions below. Otherwise, put your python version into `lab0-responses.txt`

### E1\. MacOS

If you are on MacOS, you should check out `homebrew`. The instruction for getting Python with homebrew is [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/).

### E2\. Linux

You can download python from the website, or use `sudo apt-get install python3.6`.

## F. Install `pip`

Type in `pip --version`. If you get an error, you need to install `pip`. Follow the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Once you are done, put your pip version into `lab0-responses.txt`

**DO NOT CONTINUE UNTIL YOU HAVE DONE STEPS D-F**

## G. Making a Commit

You are now ready to submit. First, run `git status`. This will show you all the files you have changed in the directory.

Run the command `git add -A`, then `git commit -m "Submit intro lab."` You should get something that goes `[main ******] Submit intro lab...`.

At this step, Git may ask you to set your username/email. If so, follow those instructions or call us over.

## H. Push the commit

The change you just made is still living on your local machine. How do you upload them to GitHub? Run the command `git push`. Then, go onto your github repository. You should see some changes there!

## I. Submit

There should be a button now called _pull request_ or _make pull request_. Click on it!

Put in a title and a description, which can be anything you want. Then, hit _open pull request_ or something like that.

Once that is done, you are done! Congratulations on finishing your first lab :D
